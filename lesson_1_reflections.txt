How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
diff command compares to files and gives text and line number where the text was changed hence helps us to find the bug.


How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
if programmer has access to enitre history, can find bugs in changes made in code easily


What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
if programmer forget to commit for a longer time duration then commits might not help to reterive history efficiently
but if programmer commits for each logical change in program GIT could help alot in reteriving old logic


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
git allow saving multiple files in 1 commit as it is basically used for programming supported version control so in that multiple files are interconnected so it will we easier to track
in vsc like google docs files are not intrconnect so there no need of saving multiple files in 1 commit


How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log to see commit history
git diff to diffrentiate to commits we should have commit ids of both the commits to be compared


How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
we could make changes without any worry about lossing current state or current code.


Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
as a version control in android development and other coding
